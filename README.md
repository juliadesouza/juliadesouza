## 👋 Welcome 

Hey there! I'm Julia, a passionate software engineer who graduated from UNICAMP with a degree in Information Systems. By day, I'm immersed in the world of full-stack development, using Node.js to power the backend and crafting sleek interfaces with React on the frontend.

When I'm not diving deep into code, you'll often find me in the kitchen, whipping up delightful desserts and fueling my adventures with countless cups of cappuccino. I'm also an avid reader, always with a good book in hand, accompanied by my loyal companion, Hanna 🐶, who believes she's a human.

I'm constantly dreaming of my next big challenge in the tech world, pushing myself to learn new technologies and sharpen my skills.
